REUTERS/Sonali Paul/File Photo</figcaption></figure>                 <p>Technologies that capture carbon dioxide emissions to keep them from the atmosphere are central to the climate strategies of many world governments as they seek to follow through on international commitments to decarbonize by mid-century.翻译:捕获二氧化碳排放并将其排除在大气中的技术是许多世界各国政府气候战略的核心，因为它们寻求履行到本世纪中叶脱碳的国际承诺。</p>   <p>They are also expensive, unproven at scale, and can be hard to sell to a nervous public.翻译:它们价格昂贵，未经大规模验证，并且很难卖给紧张的公众。</p>   <p>As nations gather for the 28th United Nations climate change conference in the United Arab Emirates at the end of November, the question of carbon capture’s future role in a climate-friendly world will be in focus. Here are some details about the state of the industry now, and the obstacles in the way of widespread deployment:</p>    <h 1="">FORMS OF CARBON CAPTURE</h>  <p>The most common form of carbon capture technology involves capturing the gas from a point source like an industrial smokestack. From there, the carbon can either be moved directly to permanent underground storage or it can be used in another industrial purpose first, variations that are respectively called carbon capture and storage (CCS) and carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS).翻译:碳捕获技术最常见的形式涉及从工业烟囱等点源捕获气体。从那里，碳可以直接转移到永久地下储存，也可以首先用于另一个工业目的，其变体分别称为碳捕获和储存（CCS）和碳捕获、利用和储存（CCUS）。</p>   <p>There are currently 42 operational commercial CCS and CCUS projects across the world with the capacity to store 49 million metric tons of carbon dioxide annually, according to the Global CCS Institute, which tracks the industry. That is about 0.13% of the world’s roughly 37 billion metric tons of annual energy and industry-related carbon dioxide emissions.翻译:据跟踪该行业的全球 CCS 研究所称，目前全球有 42 个正在运营的商业 CCS 和 CCUS 项目，每年可储存 4900 万吨二氧化碳。这约占全球每年约 370 亿吨能源和工业相关二氧化碳排放量的 0.13%。</p>   <p>Some 30 of those projects, accounting for 78% of all captured carbon from the group, use the carbon for enhanced oil recovery (EOR), in which carbon is injected into oil wells to free trapped oil. Drillers say EOR can make petroleum more climate-friendly, but environmentalists say the practice is counter-productive.翻译:其中约 30 个项目（占该集团捕获的碳总量的 78%）将碳用于提高石油采收率 (EOR)，即将碳注入油井以释放被困的石油。钻探人员表示，EOR 可以使石油变得更加气候友好，但环保人士表示，这种做法会适得其反。</p>   <p>The other 12 projects, which permanently store carbon in underground formations without using them to boost oil output, are in the U.S., Norway, Iceland, China, Canada, Qatar, and Australia, according to the Global CCS Institute.翻译:据全球 CCS 研究所称，另外 12 个项目位于美国、挪威、冰岛、中国、加拿大、卡塔尔和澳大利亚，这些项目将碳永久储存在地下地层中，而不用它们来增加石油产量。</p>   <p>Another form of carbon capture is <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/what-is-direct-air-capture-how-can-it-fight-climate-change-2023-04-18/">direct air capture</a> (DAC), in which carbon emissions are captured from the air.翻译:碳捕获的另一种形式是<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/what-is-direct-air-capture-how-can-it-fight-climate-change-2023-04-18/">直接空气捕获</a>（DAC），其中从空气中捕获碳排放。</p>   <p>About 130 DAC facilities are being planned around the world, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA), though just 27 have been commissioned and they capture just 10,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide annually.翻译:据国际能源署 (IEA) 称，全球正在规划约 130 个 DAC 设施，但只有 27 个已投入使用，并且每年仅捕获 10,000 吨二氧化碳。</p>   <p>The U.S. in August announced <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/us-awards-12-bln-oxy-climeworks-led-carbon-air-capture-hubs-2023-08-11/">$1.2 billion in grants</a> for two DAC hubs in Texas and Louisiana that promise to capture 2 million metric tons of carbon per year, though a final investment decision on the projects has not been made.</p>    <h 1="">HIGH COSTS</h>  <p>One stumbling block to rapid deployment of carbon capture technology is cost.翻译:快速部署碳捕获技术的一大障碍是成本。</p>   <p>CCS costs range from $15 to $120 per metric ton of captured carbon depending on the emissions source, and DAC projects are <a href="" target="_blank">even more</a> expensive, between $600 and $1,000 per metric ton, because of the amount of energy needed to capture carbon from the atmosphere, according to the IEA.翻译:根据排放源的不同，CCS 成本从每公吨捕获的碳 15 到 120 美元不等，而 DAC 项目<a href="" target="_blank">甚至更</a>昂贵，在每公吨 600 到 1,000 美元之间，因为从大气中捕获碳需要大量的能量。给国际能源署。</p>   <p>Some CCS projects in countries like <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/carbon-capture-project-norway-temporarily-halted-by-high-costs-2023-04-26/">Norway</a> and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/canada-oil-sands-carbon-capture-project-cannot-proceed-until-prices-locked-exec-2023-09-20/">Canada</a> have been paused for financial reasons.翻译:<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/carbon-capture-project-norway-temporarily-halted-by-high-costs-2023-04-26/">挪威</a>和<a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/canada-oil-sands-carbon-capture-project-cannot-proceed-until-prices-locked-exec-2023-09-20/">加拿大</a>等国家的一些 CCS 项目因财务原因已暂停。</p>   <p>Countries including the U.S. have <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/facing-brutal-climate-math-us-bets-billions-direct-air-capture-2023-04-18/">rolled out public subsidies</a> for carbon capture projects. The Inflation Reduction Act, passed in 2022, offers a $50 tax credit per metric ton of carbon captured for CCUS and $85 per metric ton captured for CCS, and $180 per metric ton captured through DAC.翻译:包括美国在内的国家已经<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/facing-brutal-climate-math-us-bets-billions-direct-air-capture-2023-04-18/">推出了对碳捕集项目的公共补贴</a>。 2022 年通过的《通货膨胀减少法案》为 CCUS 捕获的每公吨碳提供 50 美元的税收抵免，CCS 捕获的每公吨碳提供 85 美元的税收抵免，通过 DAC 捕获的每公吨碳提供 180 美元的税收抵免。</p>   <p>Though those are meaningful incentives, companies may still need to take on some added costs to move CCS and DAC projects ahead, said Benjamin Longstreth, global director of carbon capture at the Clean Air Task Force.翻译:清洁空气工作组碳捕获全球总监本杰明·朗斯特雷斯 (Benjamin Longstreth) 表示，尽管这些都是有意义的激励措施，但企业可能仍需要承担一些额外成本才能推进 CCS 和 DAC 项目。</p>   <p>Some CCS projects have also failed to prove out the technology's readiness. A $1 billion project to harness carbon dioxide emissions from a Texas coal plant, for example, had chronic mechanical problems and routinely missed its targets before it was shut down in 2020, according to a report submitted by the project’s owners to the U.S. Department of Energy.翻译:一些 CCS 项目也未能证明该技术的成熟度。例如，根据该项目业主向美国能源部提交的一份报告，一个耗资 10 亿美元的德克萨斯州燃煤电厂二氧化碳排放项目在 2020 年关闭之前存在长期机械问题，并且经常无法达到目标。</p>   <p>The Petra Nova project <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/carbon-capture-project-back-texas-coal-plant-after-3-year-shutdown-2023-09-14/">restarted in September</a>.</p>    <h 1="">LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION</h>  <p>Where captured carbon can be stored is limited by geology, a reality that would become more pronounced if and when carbon capture is deployed at the kind of massive scale that would be needed to make a difference to the climate. The best storage sites for carbon are in portions of North America, East Africa, and the North Sea, according to the Global CCS Institute.翻译:捕获的碳可以储存的地方受到地质的限制，如果大规模部署碳捕获来改变气候，这一现实将变得更加明显。根据全球 CCS 研究所的数据，最佳的碳储存地点位于北美、东非和北海的部分地区。</p>   <p>That means getting captured carbon to storage sites could require extensive pipeline networks or even shipping fleets – posing potential new obstacles.翻译:这意味着将捕获的碳运送到储存地点可能需要广泛的管道网络甚至运输船队——这构成了潜在的新障碍。</p>   <p>In October, for example, a $3 billion CCS pipeline project proposed by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/navigator-co2-ventures-cancels-carbon-capture-pipeline-project-us-midwest-2023-10-20/">Navigator CO2 Ventures</a> in the U.S. Midwest - meant to move carbon from heartland ethanol plants to good storage sites - was canceled amid concerns from residents about potential leaks and construction damage.翻译:例如，10 月份， <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/navigator-co2-ventures-cancels-carbon-capture-pipeline-project-us-midwest-2023-10-20/">Navigator CO2 Ventures</a>在美国中西部提议的一个价值 30 亿美元的 CCS 管道项目——旨在将碳从中心地带的乙醇工厂转移到良好的储存地点——由于居民担心潜在的泄漏和建筑损坏而被取消。</p>   <p>Companies investing in carbon removal need to take seriously community concerns about new infrastructure projects, said Simone Stewart, industrial policy specialist at the National Wildlife Federation.翻译:国家野生动物联合会产业政策专家西蒙·斯图尔特表示，投资碳清除的公司需要认真对待社区对新基础设施项目的担忧。</p>   <p>"Not all technologies are going to be possible in all locations," Stewart said.翻译:“并非所有技术都可以在所有地点使用，”斯图尔特说。</p>    <span>Reporting by Leah Douglas

Its Q3 <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/nvidia-forecasts-fourth-quarter-revenue-above-estimates-2023-11-21/">earnings</a> handily beat the Street, as did its forecasts for Q4, although the bullish expectations built into this stock are so immense its shares still eased a touch.翻译:早期的焦点是英伟达<a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/NVDA.O" target="_blank">（NVDA.O）</a> ，从人工智能技术的角度来看，该公司是淘金热期间唯一一家销售铲子的公司。该公司第三季度的<a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/nvidia-forecasts-fourth-quarter-revenue-above-estimates-2023-11-21/">盈利</a>轻松超过了华尔街，第四季度的预测也是如此，尽管对该股的看涨预期如此之大，但其股价仍然有所回落。</p>   <p>The company conceded that sales to China would be significantly reduced by Washington's restrictions on tech transfers, but balanced that by saying the drop would be more than offset by strong growth in other regions.翻译:该公司承认，由于华盛顿对技术转让的限制，对中国的销售将大幅减少，但平衡说，其他地区的强劲增长将足以抵消这一下降。</p>   <p>This caused some wild swings in after-hours trading, its stock sinking under $475.00 at one stage - quite a move given that each dollar is worth $2.5 billion in market cap for the $1.2 trillion company.翻译:这导致盘后交易出现剧烈波动，其股价一度跌破 475.00 美元——考虑到这家市值 1.2 万亿美元的公司，每一美元的市值都达到 25 亿美元，这是一个相当大的举动。</p>   <p>Volumes were so large and orders so backlogged that the price was - unusually - still moving erratically hours into the Asian day. The stock was last indicated at $490.75, down 1.7% from the official close of $499.44.翻译:成交量如此之大，订单如此积压，以至于价格在亚洲交易日的几个小时内仍然异常波动，这是不同寻常的。该股最后报490.75美元，较官方收盘价499.44美元下跌1.7%。</p>   <p>The other big tech news was <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-authorities-set-unveil-settlement-with-binance-source-2023-11-21/">Binance</a> chief Changpeng Zhao pleading guilty to breaking U.S. anti-money laundering laws as part of a whopping $4.3 billion settlement. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/changpeng-zhao-crypto-king-binance-chief-ousted-us-crimes-2023-11-21/">Zhao</a> stepped down and will pay a $50 million fine, but could also face a prison term.翻译:另一条重大科技新闻是<a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-authorities-set-unveil-settlement-with-binance-source-2023-11-21/">币安</a>首席执行官赵长鹏承认违反美国反洗钱法，作为 43 亿美元和解协议的一部分。 <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/changpeng-zhao-crypto-king-binance-chief-ousted-us-crimes-2023-11-21/">赵先生</a>下台，将支付 5000 万美元的罚款，但也可能面临监禁。</p>   <p>Back in the old world, minutes of the Fed's last meeting didn't really shift the dial on the policy outlook, at least for markets. The FOMC is clearly on hold and it would take an inflation shock to get them to consider another hike. Equally, "all participants" agreed policy would have to stay tight for some time to come.翻译:回到过去，美联储上次会议纪要并没有真正改变政策前景，至少对市场来说是这样。联邦公开市场委员会 (FOMC) 显然已按兵不动，只有通胀冲击才会让他们考虑再次加息。同样，“所有参与者”都同意政策必须在未来一段时间内保持紧缩。</p>   <p>There was a lot of talk about the September-October rout in the bond market having tightened financial conditions, but since that meeting 10-year yields have dropped more than 50 basis points. That would normally add to the case for staying high for longer.翻译:关于9月至10月债券市场溃败导致金融状况收紧的讨论很多，但自那次会议以来，10年期国债收益率已下跌超过50个基点。这通常会增加人们更长时间保持高水平的理由。</p>   <p>But the market apparently doesn't see it exactly that way, with a March rate cut priced at a 29% probability and a May easing at 60%. Futures still imply around 93 bps of cuts for 2024.翻译:但市场显然并不完全这么认为，3 月份降息的可能性为 29%，5 月份宽松的可能性为 60%。期货仍暗示 2024 年降息约 93 个基点。</p>   <p>Treasury 10-year yields were up 1 basis point at 4.41% , but not far from the recent low of 4.397%. Major currencies were also little changed, although China's central bank did set another firm fix for its yuan, suggesting it is serious this time about stopping the decline.翻译:10年期国债收益率上涨1个基点至4.41%，但距离近期低点4.397%不远。主要货币也几乎没有变化，尽管中国央行确实再次确定了人民币汇率，表明这一次是认真阻止人民币贬值的。</p>   <p>Later on Wednesday, Sweden's central bank will meet in what is expected to be a very close call on whether to hike again. A Reuters poll showed 10 of 19 economists looked for a rise, while market pricing is leaning against a move. A steady decision would likely be taken as the end of the cycle and put the crown under pressure, which argues for a hike today.翻译:周三晚些时候，瑞典央行将召开会议，讨论是否再次加息，预计这将是一次非常接近的会议。路透社的一项民意调查显示，19 名经济学家中有 10 名预计会上涨，而市场定价则倾向于上涨。一个稳定的决定可能会作为周期的结束而做出，并使克朗面临压力，这使得今天加息成为可能。</p>   <p>Key developments that could influence markets on Wednesday:翻译:周三可能影响市场的主要事态发展：</p>   <p>- Euro Zone consumer confidence flash for Nov翻译:- 11 月份欧元区消费者信心指数快报</p>   <p>- Riksbank holds monetary policy meeting翻译:- 瑞典央行召开货币政策会议</p>   <p>- British finance minister Hunt releases Autumn Statement翻译:- 英国财政大臣亨特发布秋季声明</p>   <p>- Appearances by ECB's Centeno and board member Elderson翻译:- 欧洲央行 Centeno 和董事会成员埃尔德森出席</p>   <p>- Fed Bank of Cleveland President Mester speaks翻译:——克利夫兰联储行长梅斯特讲话</p>   <p>- Speech by Bank of Canada Governor Macklem翻译:- 加拿大央行行长麦克勒姆致辞</p>    <span>By Wayne Cole; Editing by Edmund Klamann翻译:作者：韦恩·科尔；编辑：埃德蒙·克拉曼</span>]]></description>

Such surveillance had been curtailed under the pact, South Korean officials said.</p>    <h 1="">WHAT HAPPENED IN 2018?</h>  <p>The so-called Comprehensive Military Agreement (CMA) signed between the two Koreas in 2018 was the most substantive deal to result from months of historic meetings between leader Kim Jong Un and then-South Korean President Moon Jae-in.翻译:朝韩两国于 2018 年签署的所谓全面军事协议 (CMA) 是领导人金正恩与时任韩国总统文在寅数月历史性会晤后达成的最具实质性协议。</p>   <p>On Sept. 19, 2018, South Korea's defence minister and his North Korean counterpart signed the CMA in the North's capital, Pyongyang, accompanied by polite applause from the onlooking leaders.翻译:2018 年 9 月 19 日，韩国国防部长和朝鲜国防部长在朝鲜首都平壤签署了 CMA，旁观领导人报以礼貌的掌声。</p>   <p>Under the CMA, both countries agreed to "completely cease all hostile acts against each other" that are the source of military tension and conflict, by implementing military confidence-building measures in the air, land, and sea domains.翻译:根据《全面停火协议》，两国同意通过在空中、陆地和海上领域实施军事信任建设措施，“完全停止一切针对彼此的敌对行为”，这些行为是军事紧张和冲突的根源。</p>   <p>The measures included the two sides ending military drills near the border, banning live-fire exercises in certain areas, the imposition of no-fly zones, the removal of some guard posts along the Demilitarized Zone, and maintaining hotlines.翻译:这些措施包括双方结束边境附近的军事演习、禁止在某些地区进行实弹演习、设立禁飞区、拆除非军事区沿线的一些哨所以及维持热线电话。</p>   <p>On the ground, both sides agreed to completely cease artillery drills and field training within 5 kilometres (3 miles) of the Military Demarcation Line (MDL) between the countries.翻译:在地面上，双方同意完全停止两国军事分界线（MDL）5公里（3英里）范围内的炮兵演习和野战训练。</p>   <p>At sea, the two sides installed covers on the barrels of naval guns and coastal artillery and closed gun ports in a buffer zone along the sea border.</p>    <h 1="">MILITARY DEAL AT RISK</h>  <p>With inter-Korean and denuclearisation talks long stalled, recent drills and shows of force along the fortified border between the Koreas have cast <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/deal-reducing-military-tensions-with-north-korea-could-go-back-square-one-2022-10-27/">doubts</a> on the future of the measures, which were meant to reduce tensions.翻译:由于朝韩和无核化谈判长期陷入僵局，最近在韩朝边境上举行的演习和武力展示让人们对这些旨在缓解紧张局势的措施的未来产生了<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/deal-reducing-military-tensions-with-north-korea-could-go-back-square-one-2022-10-27/">怀疑</a>。</p>   <p>South Korea had accused Pyongyang of violating the agreement after North Korean artillery shells fell into a maritime buffer zone that was supposed to be free of live-fire drills under the agreement.翻译:朝鲜炮弹落入海上缓冲区后，韩国指责平壤违反了该协议，而根据该协议，该缓冲区本应免于进行实弹演习。</p>   <p>The North then said South Korea had resumed the use of propaganda loudspeakers at the border in violation of the agreement. South Korea denied the accusation.翻译:朝鲜随后表示，韩国已恢复在边境使用宣传扬声器，这违反了协议。韩国否认了这一指控。</p>   <p>Kim Myung-soo, nominee for South Korea's chairman of joint chiefs of staff, said last week that the 2018 agreement limited his military's surveillance of North Korea and live-fire drills near the maritime border.</p>    <h 1="">WHAT PARTS OF AGREEMENT WILL BE SUSPENDED?</h>  <p>South Korea's national security council said on Tuesday it planned to "suspend the effect of Article 1, Clause 3" of the 2018 military agreement, enabling Seoul to restore reconnaissance and surveillance activities along the border.翻译:韩国国家安全委员会周二表示，计划“暂停2018年军事协议第一条第三款的效力”，使首尔能够恢复边境沿线的侦察和监视活动。</p>   <p>Under that clause, both countries agreed to establish no-fly zones close to their border.翻译:根据该条款，两国同意在边境附近建立禁飞区。</p>   <p>South Korea's military will restart aerial surveillance in border areas, which had been conducted before the agreement was signed, the defence ministry said.翻译:韩国国防部表示，韩国军方将重启协议签署前在边境地区进行的空中监视。</p>   <p>South Korea said, however, its decisions on whether to take further actions to pull out of the military agreement would depend on the North's follow-up moves.翻译:不过，韩国表示，是否采取进一步行动退出军事协议的决定将取决于朝鲜的后续行动。</p>    <span>Reporting by Ju-min Park; Editing by Ed Davies and Gerry Doyle翻译:朴柱民报道；艾德·戴维斯和格里·多伊尔编辑</span>]]></description>

One adviser will propose a 4.5% target, while the other suggested a 5.0-5.5% range.翻译:接受路透社采访的七名顾问中有五名表示，他们赞成将目标定为 5% 左右，与今年的目标相符。一位顾问将提出 4.5% 的目标，而另一位顾问则建议 5.0-5.5% 的范围。</p>   <p>The proposals will be made next month at the ruling Communist Party's annual Central Economic Work Conference that discusses policy plans and the outlook for the world's second-largest economy.翻译:这些建议将于下个月在执政的共产党年度中央经济工作会议上提出，会议将讨论世界第二大经济体的政策计划和前景。</p>   <p>Reaching such targets would require Beijing to step up fiscal stimulus, the advisers said, given that this year's growth has been flattered by last year's low-base effect of COVID-19 lockdowns.翻译:顾问们表示，要实现这些目标，北京需要加大财政刺激力度，因为今年的经济增长因去年新冠病毒 (COVID-19) 封锁的低基数效应而受到影响。</p>   <p>"We need to adopt expansionary fiscal and monetary policy to stimulate aggregate demand," Yu Yongding, a government economist who advocates for a growth target of roughly 5%, told Reuters.翻译:“我们需要采取扩张性财政和货币政策来刺激总需求，”主张5%左右增长目标的政府经济学家余永定对路透社表示。</p>   <p>"Corporate investment demand will not be strong as the confidence of companies has not recovered, so we need to expand infrastructure investment," added Yu, who also favours a budget deficit topping 4% of economic output.翻译:于补充说：“由于企业信心尚未恢复，企业投资需求不会强劲，因此我们需要扩大基础设施投资。”他还支持预算赤字占经济产出的4%以上。</p>   <p>The other advisers spoke on condition of anonymity due to the closed-door nature of the discussions. Top leaders are expected to endorse the target at the December meeting, although it will not be announced publicly until China's annual parliament meeting, usually held in March.翻译:由于讨论是闭门性质的，其他顾问都要求匿名。预计最高领导人将在 12 月的会议上批准这一目标，不过要到通常在 3 月份举行的中国年度人大会议才会公开宣布这一目标。</p>   <p>In October, China unveiled a plan to issue 1 trillion yuan ($139 billion) in sovereign bonds by the end of the year, raising the 2023 budget deficit target to 3.8% of gross domestic product (GDP) from the original 3%.翻译:10月，中国公布了在年底前发行1万亿元人民币（1,390亿美元）主权债券的计划，将2023年预算赤字目标从原来占国内生产总值（GDP）的3%提高到3.8%。</p>   <p>Chinese leaders have pledged to "optimize the structure of central and local government debt", suggesting the central government <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/asia/china-can-no-longer-extend-pretend-municipal-debt-2023-08-06/">has room to spend</a> more as its debt as a share of GDP is just 21%, far lower than 76% for local governments.翻译:中国领导人承诺“优化中央和地方政府债务结构”，这表明中央政府<a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/asia/china-can-no-longer-extend-pretend-municipal-debt-2023-08-06/">有增加支出的空间</a>，因为其债务占GDP的比重仅为21%，远低于地方政府的76%。</p>   <p>"We are stepping up fiscal policy support," said another adviser, to make the "difficult" 2024 target "achievable."翻译:另一位顾问表示：“我们正在加大财政政策支持力度，以使 2024 年“困难的”目标“能够实现”。</p>   <p>Monetary stimulus is expected to play a more limited role as the central bank remains concerned a widening interest rate differential with the West may further weaken the yuan and encourage capital outflows.翻译:由于央行仍担心与西方利差扩大可能进一步压低人民币并鼓励资本外流，预计货币刺激措施的作用将更加有限。</p>   <p>"The space for monetary policy could be bigger if we have greater tolerance for exchange rate fluctuations," said Guan Tao, global chief economist at BOC International and a former official at the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE).</p>    <h 1="">REFORMS VS STIMULUS</h>  <p>China’s economy grew only 3% in 2022, one of its worst performances in nearly half a century.

As CEO, he remained in control of minute operational detail, at the same time posting social media selfies with world leaders and city mayors.翻译:<a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/fintech-crypto-binance-zhao/">路透社去年的一份报告发现</a>，从公司成立之初，赵就一直严格控制币安，作为一个致力于保密并专注于市场统治的强大领导者。作为首席执行官，他仍然控制着微小的运营细节，同时在社交媒体上发布与世界领导人和市长的自拍照。</p>   <p>Zhao installed a tight circle of associates, many of whom had worked or studied in China, into top jobs. Co-founder Yi He now runs Binance's venture capital arm, as well as other key departments.翻译:赵安排了一个紧密的同事圈子担任高层职务，其中许多人曾在中国工作或学习过。联合创始人何一现在负责币安的风险投资部门以及其他关键部门。</p>   <p>As Binance hired more widely from traditional financial and regulatory worlds, Zhao's tight control over his company was undiminished. The company, which calls itself an "ecosystem," has set up more than 70 entities, most controlled by Zhao personally.翻译:随着币安从传统金融和监管领域广泛招聘人才，赵对公司的严格控制并未减弱。该公司自称为“生态系统”，已设立 70 多个实体，其中大部分由赵个人控制。</p>   <p>"Zhao answers to no one but himself," the Commodity Futures Trading Commission wrote in March after suing Binance for operating what it called a "sham" compliance program.翻译:商品期货交易委员会在 3 月份起诉币安运营其所谓的“虚假”合规计划后写道：“赵除了他自己之外，不向任何人负责。”</p>   <p>It is unclear whether Zhao will now relinquish control of the firms. In the meantime, one of his appointees will take over running Binance.翻译:目前尚不清楚赵是否会放弃对这些公司的控制权。与此同时，他任命的一名人员将接管币安的运营。</p>   <p>Richard Teng, a senior Binance executive who joined in 2021, is the new CEO, Zhao posted on social media on Tuesday. Teng "will ensure Binance delivers on our next phase of security, transparency, compliance, and growth," he said.翻译:赵周二在社交媒体上发布消息称，2021 年加入币安的高级高管理查德·滕 (Richard Teng) 担任新任首席执行官。他表示：“Teng 将确保币安实现下一阶段的安全性、透明度、合规性和增长。”</p>    <span>Reporting by Tom Wilson in London; Editing by Lisa Shumaker and Bill Berkrot翻译:汤姆·威尔逊 (Tom Wilson) 伦敦报道；丽莎·舒梅克和比尔·伯克罗特编辑</span>]]></description>

down</a> and pleaded guilty to breaking criminal U.S. anti-money laundering laws as part of a $4.3 billion settlement resolving a years-long probe into the world's largest crypto exchange, prosecutors said on Tuesday.翻译:检察官周二表示，币安首席执行官<a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-authorities-set-unveil-settlement-with-binance-source-2023-11-21/">赵长鹏辞职</a>，并承认违反了美国反洗钱刑事法，这是一项 43 亿美元和解协议的一部分，以解决对全球最大加密货币交易所长达数年的调查。</p>   <p>The agreement will resolve criminal charges that Binance conducted an unlicensed money transmitter business, conspiracy and breaching sanctions regulations, the U.S. Department of Justice said.翻译:美国司法部表示，该协议将解决对币安进行无牌汇款业务、共谋和违反制裁规定的刑事指控。</p>   <p>Some of the charges, which are both criminal and civil, relate to practices that Reuters reported first in a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/section/binance-a-crypto-black-hole/">series of articles in 2022.</a>翻译:其中一些刑事和民事指控与路透社<a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/section/binance-a-crypto-black-hole/">2022 年在一系列文章中首次报道的做法有关。</a></p>   <p>Here are the key allegations against Binance, its founder Zhao and other executives.</p>    <h 1="">UNLICENSED MONEY SERVICE BUSINESS</h>  <p>The U.S. said that Binance, Zhao and other executives "knowingly and willfully conspired" to operate as an unlicensed money services business (MSB) from August 2017 until October 2022.翻译:美国表示，币安、赵和其他高管“故意并故意合谋”从 2017 年 8 月到 2022 年 10 月期间以无牌货币服务企业 (MSB) 的身份开展业务。</p>   <p>The exchange failed to register with the U.S. Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) as an MSB partly to prevent U.S. regulators discovering it facilitated crypto trades for its clients without proper checks on its users, the U.S. said.翻译:美国表示，该交易所未能在美国财政部金融犯罪执法网络（FinCEN）注册为 MSB，部分原因是为了防止美国监管机构发现该交易所在未对其用户进行适当检查的情况下为客户提供加密货币交易便利。</p>   <p>The move was designed to allow Binance to "gain market share and profit as quickly as possible," the U.S. said, with the exchange attracting a "substantial number of U.S. users" to its main website.翻译:美国表示，此举旨在让币安“尽快获得市场份额和利润”，并吸引“大量美国用户”访问其主要网站。</p>   <p>Binance "chose not to comply" with U.S. rules as it "determined that doing so would limit its ability to attract and maintain U.S. users."</p>    <h 1="">MONEY LAUNDERING CHECKS</h>  <p>The U.S. said that Binance facilitated "billions of dollars" of crypto transactions for its customers, including in the United States, without implementing so-called "know your customer" checks.翻译:美国表示，币安为其客户（包括美国客户）提供了“数十亿美元”的加密货币交易，但没有实施所谓的“了解你的客户”检查。</p>   <p>Binance's compliance personnel, including its compliance officer, recognised that the exchange's anti-money laundering controls "were inadequate and would attract criminals to the platform," the U.S. said.翻译:美国表示，币安的合规人员，包括其合规官员，认识到该交易所的反洗钱控制措施“不足，会吸引犯罪分子来到该平台”。</p>   <p>Binance processed transactions by operators of "illicit mixing services" used to obfuscate the provenance of crypto funds, and "laundered proceeds of darknet market transactions, hacks, ransomware, and scams," the U.S. said.翻译:美国表示，币安处理“非法混合服务”运营商的交易，这些服务用于混淆加密货币资金的来源，并“洗掉暗网市场交易、黑客、勒索软件和诈骗的收益”。</p>   <p>Between August 2017 and April 2022, bitcoin worth $106 million was sent between Binance.com wallets and Hydra, a popular Russian darknet marketplace "frequently utilized by criminals that facilitated the sale of illegal goods and services," the U.S. said.</p>    <h 1="">SANCTIONS VIOLATIONS</h>  <p>The U.S. said that Binance had a "significant customer base" from some sanctioned jurisdictions and was aware that Iran represented "the majority of such customers."翻译:美国表示，币安拥有来自一些受制裁司法管辖区的“重要客户群”，并意识到伊朗代表了“此类客户的大多数”。</p>   <p>Binance knew that it would allow transactions between U.S. users and those subject to U.S. sanctions, "in violation with U.S. law," the U.S. said.翻译:美国表示，币安知道它将允许美国用户与受美国制裁的用户之间进行交易，“这违反了美国法律”。</p>   <p>From around January 2018 to May 2022, Binance processed 1.1 million crypto transactions worth at least $898.6 million between U.S. customers and those who lived in Iran, the U.S. said.翻译:美国表示，从 2018 年 1 月左右到 2022 年 5 月，币安在美国客户和伊朗居民之间处理了 110 万笔加密货币交易，价值至少 8.986 亿美元。</p>   <p>Around 2019, Binance continued to serve "thousands of users" identified as being from sanctioned countries, the U.S. said, including over 12,500 users who provided Iranian phone numbers.</p>    <h 1="">'TERRORIST' FINANCING</h>  <p>Binance failed to report suspicious transactions associated with Palestinian militant group Hamas, the authorities said.翻译:当局表示，币安未能报告与巴勒斯坦激进组织哈马斯有关的可疑交易。</p>   <p>Crypto wallets at Binance were found to interact with bitcoin wallets associated with groups proscribed as terrorist organisations by the United States and other countries, including Islamic State, the armed wing of Hamas, al Qaeda, and the Palestine Islamic Jihad (PIJ), the U.S. said.翻译:币安的加密钱包被发现与被美国和其他国家列为恐怖组织的组织相关的比特币钱包进行交互，这些组织包括伊斯兰国、哈马斯武装派别、基地组织和巴勒斯坦伊斯兰圣战组织 (PIJ)、美国说。</p>    <span>Reporting by Elizabeth Howcroft and Tom Wilson in
